    quote: There were moments, when the girl was lying in the forest and when she was looking up at the lake above her, which were purely beautiful.

    quote: Definitely not one to see if you would like a laid-back and relaxing show, but for an intense and heart-wrenching performance that leaves you a little shaken, go and watch A Girl is a Half-Formed Thing.

synopsis: |
  'I met a man. I met a man. And I lay down. And slapped and cried and wined and dined. I met a man and many more and I didn’t know you at all.'

  In religious, rural Ireland, a young girl takes us on a journey through her tumultuous life. Privy to her every thought as she lives through the experiences and traumas that will shape her forever.

  Eimear McBride’s revolutionary experimental novel, transformed into an engaging play, explores what it is to love, lose and hurt, and to experience the world as a half-formed thing.

This was a fun project to work on. There were fun flashing lights and only a small amount of rubber crumb ended up in France.
