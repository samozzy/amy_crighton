synopsis: |
  Adam is gone, presumed dead. He was last seen on the edge of a deep, disused shaft, with a group of teenagers throwing stones at him. They may be guilty, but they have no intention of getting caught.

  This is a black comedy that chillingly unfolds to demonstrate the power of group psychology and the extremes to which each member will go to protect themselves and their friends.

    quote: This production is an interesting psychological experience and contained a good balance of humour and intensity. It is definitely a piece to be proud of for the effort and attention to detail.
